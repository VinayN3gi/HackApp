Healthcare App: Solving Data Interoperability
This repository contains the code for a healthcare app designed to address the challenge of data interoperability in the healthcare sector. The app is built using React Native for the frontend, Tailwind CSS for UI styling, Express for the backend, MongoDB for the database, and Expo Router for routing.

Problem Statement
In the healthcare industry, data interoperability remains a significant challenge. Health data is often stored in disparate systems that don't communicate with each other effectively. This fragmentation can lead to inefficiencies in patient care, redundant data entry, and compromised patient safety.

Solution
Our healthcare app aims to bridge this gap by providing a platform for seamless data exchange and interoperability. By leveraging modern technologies such as React Native, Tailwind CSS, Express, MongoDB, and Expo Router, we offer a user-friendly and efficient solution for healthcare providers and patients alike.

Tech Stack
React Native: A popular JavaScript framework for building cross-platform mobile apps.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs quickly.
Express: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework for building APIs and server-side applications.
MongoDB: A flexible and scalable NoSQL database for storing app data.
Expo Router: A routing library for React Native apps built with Expo, providing navigation functionality.
